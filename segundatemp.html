  <p class="paragrafo">THE BOYS is an irreverent take on what happens when superheroes, who are as popular as
    celebrities, as influential as politicians and as revered as gods, abuse their superpowers rather than using them
    for good. It's powerless versus superpower, as the boys embark on a heroic journey to expose the truth about "The
    Seven" with the support of Vought.</p>

          <h1>STAN EDGAR</h1>
          <p>Stan Edgar began his career as an associate for “Vought American” in 1984. Calm, collected, yet
            ruthless, he rose to become chief Executive for the modern day Vought International. As pretty
            much the only person who’s not afraid of Homelander, Edgar is the cool-headed puppet-master with
            a shadowy past; he pulls the strings that move Vought forward—no matter the cost.</p>

          <p>Ashley’s had a tough job over the past year. She’s still working as the Vice President of Hero
            Management at Vought, but her primary responsibility is Homelander. And since the news about
            Stormfront came out a year ago, and Homelander’s approval ratings took a dive because of it,
            Ashley’s not only had to manage his volatile publicity, she’s also had to tiptoe around his
            nuclear temper.</p>

          <p>Despite everything she’s been through, Annie January is still as down-to-earth and sincere as
            they come; the girl next door with superpowers. Today, she’s one of America’s favorite
            superheroes, polling at a 96% approval rating, a new Vought record! But the popularity, poll
            numbers, and brand endorsements mean nothing to her — because all she wants is the same thing
            she’s always wanted: to save the world.</p>

          <p>Since the news broke about Stormfront’s Nazi past, Homelander’s been on a year-long apology tour.
            Now his approval ratings are in the toilet, and worst of all, he’s had to play nice with
            everyone after Queen Maeve blackmailed him with the Flight 37 video. But the most powerful man
            in the world is fed up with being restrained – and it’s only a matter of time before his rage
            boils over.

          <p>Silent, stealthy, and enigmatic. Black Noir is The Seven’s superpowered ninja. His superstrength

            about this lethal warrior, other than his having trained with a master sensei to become the

            and cynical exterior, Maeve is getting worried. She can see the cracks forming in Homelander’s

            Fans, paparazzi, and reporters are all asking when they’re going to see him race again. And

          <p>After defecting from the Church of the Collective, The Deep has become a favorite on the national
            talk show circuit with the success of his (ghost-written) memoir, Deeper, about his escape from
            the cult. And with his brilliant wife, Cassandra, coaching him along, he’s finally getting the
            recognition he thinks he deserves. But none of that compares to being a hero in The Seven. And

          <p>He was America’s first and greatest superhero before Homelander. He helped good triumph over evil
            in WWII. With his superteam, Payback, he fought for liberty and justice for all, until
            heroically sacrificing his own life to save America from a nuclear plant meltdown in 1984. But
            behind the glossy myth, there’s a lot the world doesn’t know about Soldier Boy — and some things
